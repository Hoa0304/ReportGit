### Next Steps

1. Creating a new branch: Use the git branch command to create a new branch for your work. You can then use git checkout to switch to that branch.

2. Making changes: Make changes to your files as needed. You can use git add to stage changes for commit.

3. Committing changes: Use git commit to commit your changes to the current branch.

4. Pushing changes: Use git push to push your changes to a remote repository.

5. Pulling changes: Use git pull to pull changes from a remote repository into your local repository.

6. Merging changes: Use git merge to merge changes from one branch into another.

7. Resolving conflicts: If there are conflicts between different versions of a file, use git mergetool to resolve them.

8. Reverting changes: Use git revert to undo changes made in a previous commit.
